# multicluster-canary

This lab will consist on one mgmt cluster which will be named the hub cluster, in which we will have argoCD hub running.

We will have two workload clusters, in which we will install istio in multicluster primary-primary mode; each of the will have the helloworld-v1 application.

The purpose of this lab is making a canary upgrade of our helloword application from v1 to v2, using argocd rollouts. Both workload clusters will be sharing traffic, and rollouts will be consuming metrics of a federated prometheus on the mgmt cluster. 

So both apps deployed in workload clusters will perform the canary upgrade at the same time consuming same metrics in a multi-cluster approach.

## Deploy clusters

For deploying our clusters, we have a sample script for deploying eks managed clusters with eksctl, you can run create-eks-cluster.sh script in parent folder of the repo.

You must install one hub cluster, which will be the mgmt one:

```
./create-eks-cluster.sh -n argo-hub -t mesh-mgmt
```

And two workload clusters which will contain the istio installation and resources, the apps and the rollouts:

```
./create-eks-cluster.sh -n argo-rollout1 -t mesh-workload
./create-eks-cluster.sh -n argo-rollout2 -t mesh-workload
```

## Install Istio Multi-Cluster

In our case we have installed istio Multi-Primary on different networks, following istio [docs](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/multicluster/multi-primary_multi-network/)

Please don't forget to [verify you installation](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/multicluster/verify/) deploying sample apps and making sure that you are able to reach both workload clusters from any of them.
